# Introduction to python. 

## What is python ? 

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It is known for its simplicity and readability, which makes it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Python emphasizes code readability by using indentation and a clean syntax, which reduces the need for complex braces and semicolons.

## Why python, What can python do ? 
Python is a versatile programming language that can be used for a wide range of applications. Here are some of the things Python can do:

- Web Development
- Data Analysis and Visualization.
- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
- Scientific Computing
- Scripting and Automation
- Game Development
- Desktop GUI Applications
- Networking and Internet Protocols
- Scripting for Software and System Administration
- Education and Learning

These are just a few examples of what Python can do. 


# Python syntax
Python syntax refers to the set of rules and conventions that define the structure and formatting of Python code. Following the correct syntax is crucial for writing valid and executable Python programs. Here are some key aspects of Python syntax.

- Indentation
- Statements and Lines
- Comments
- Variables and Data Types
- Function Definitions

# Python comment
- Single Line Comment. #
- Multi-Line Comment. """ ... """

# Variable
Variable is used to store data to computer memory.

Syntax:
```Python
variable_name = "Variable Value"
```

# Data Types
Data types are the different categories in which data can be stored, handle and manipulated in python. These data types are objects.

- String(str)
- Integer(int): whole numbers without precisions. E.g 1, -1, -344, 122322.

- Boolean(bool): Either True or False.

- Float Point(float): Numbers with precisions. E.g 0.122, -2901.23.

- Complex Number(complex): Imaginary numbers. E.g: (89 + 9j).



# Basic Data Structures
These are forms in which 1 variable can hold more than 1 values.

- List: 
  - Used to hold sequence of values. 
  - It is ordered that is,  It stores it's element just the way they were entered in the list. 
  - It's elements can be changed.

- Tuple: 
  - Used to hold sequence of unique values. 
  - It is ordered that is,  It stores it's element just the way they were entered in the tuple.

- Set: 
  - Used to hold sequence of unique values. 
  - It is unordered that is,  It doesn't store it's element just the way they were entered in the set.

- Dictionary:
  - Used to hold key-value pairs.
  - It is unordered.

# Type Conversion
- This is the automatic conversion of data to specific type usually to a type that is bigger.
- The Python Interpreter handles Type conversions.
Example: integer to float.


# Type Casting
- Conversion from float to integer.
- Manual type conversion in Python. That is, a conversion the programmer does by him/her self.
- Mostly converting from bigger data type to smaller, but can be in any form.


# Operators
- Arithmetics Operator:
  - (+, -, /, *, %, **, //)
  - // -> It returns the number of times a number divides the certain number.
  - % -> It returns the remainder of a division.

- Assignment Operator:
  - (=, +=, -=, /=, //=, *=, **=, %=)

- Logical Operator:
  - (and, or)

- Comparison Operator:
  - (==, <, >, <=, >=)

- Identity Operator:
  - (is, is not)

- Membership Operator:
  - (in, not in)

- Bitwise Operators:
  - This haven't been studied.

- Conditions and Chained Conditions:
  - Condition refers to a statement or an expression that evaluates to either true or false. This uses conditional operators, e.g >, < ...
  
  - Chained conditions, also known as compound conditions or multiple conditions, refer to using multiple conditions together to create more complex logic in programming. This uses 'and' or 'or' logical operators.

# String Data Type
Sequence of characters stored within a single, double or triple quotes. E.g: 
```Python
'Cryptic Wisdom'
" Is a"
""" Python Programmer."""
```
