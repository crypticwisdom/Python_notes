    * Custom Types 
    * Specialized Datatype
- Mutable and immutable data types.
- Type conversion.
- Type casting (manual type conversion in Python).
- Operators: Logical, comparison, arithmetic, assignment, identity (`is`, `is not`), membership (`in`, `not in`), bitwise.
- Operator precedence: [(), *, /, etc.]

### 1b. Control Structures
- Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`.
- Loops: `for` and `while`.
- Chained conditions.
- Ternary operators, match statements.

### 1c. Functions and Modules

- Defining and using functions.
- Creating and importing modules.
- Lambda (anonymous functions).
- Built-In Functions.
- Math Functions


### 1d. Data Structures
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

### 1e. Advanced Data Handling

- Unpacking: Assigning elements of a list to multiple variables.
- Iterables and iterators.
- `yield`.
- Scope.
- Modules.

### 1f. Exception Handling

- Try-except blocks for handling errors.
- Custom exceptions.

### 1g. File I/O

- Reading and writing files.
- Working with different file formats (e.g., JSON, CSV).

### 1h. Decorators and Generators

- Understanding and creating decorators.
- Defining and using generators for efficient memory usage.

### 1i. Functional Programming

- Lambda functions.
- `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions.

### 1j. Regular Expressions

- Pattern matching and text manipulation using regex.

## --- (2) Intermediate

- Strong OOP concepts: Class, object, and method.
- Name mangling.
- Data structures.
- Comprehensions.
- Date manipulation.
- Lambda functions/anonymous functions.
- `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions.
- Collections.
- `*args` and `**kwargs`.
- Inheritance in OOP.
- Dunder methods.
- PIP.
- Environments.
- Modules.
- Async IO.

## (3) Advanced Topics

### Threading and Concurrency

- Basics of threading.
- Working with threads and concurrent code.

- Multi-threading.

### Advanced Data Structures

- Stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- Understanding when to use each data structure.

### Testing and Debugging

- Writing unit tests (PyTest).
- Debugging techniques and tools (e.g., `pdb`).

### Other Advanced Topics

- Meta classes.
- Context managers.
- Dynamic programming.
- CPython.

### Secure Coding Practices

- Writing secure code to prevent vulnerabilities.

### Design Patterns

- Common design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer.

### Code Optimization

- Profiling and optimizing code for performance.

### Best Practices

- Adhering to Python coding standards (PEP 8) and writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.

## Miscellaneous

### Database Interaction

- Connecting to databases.
- Using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries like SQLAlchemy.

### Networking and APIs

- Making HTTP requests.
- Working with RESTful APIs.

### Version Control

- Git and GitHub.
